| TRIAL DESCRIPTION |
| Public title | How Different Types of Exercise Order Affect Heart Health and Blood Markers in People with Type 2 Diabetes. |
| Official scientific title | Cardiovascular Function and Biochemical Biomarkers Response to Concurrent Training: Effect of Exercise Sequence on Type II Diabetic Patients: A Randomized Control Trial |
| Brief summary describing the background<br> and objectives of the trial | Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the world's most common chronic diseases, causing significant morbidity, death, and economic burden, particularly in low- and middle-income nations like Ethiopia. It is intimately linked to obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and cardiovascular problems. While pharmacological therapies are still vital, lifestyle changes, particularly structured exercise, are strongly advised to improve diabetic control, cardiovascular function, and overall health.<br>Both aerobic and resistance training have demonstrated benefits, and combining them has resulted in superior improvements in glucose metabolism, lipid profile, blood pressure, and body composition among T2DM patients. However, the order in which aerobic and resistance workouts are performed (exercise sequence) may alter these adaptations because of the "interference effect." Despite evidence in healthy populations, there is little study on the effect of exercise sequence on cardiovascular and biochemical results in diabetic patients, especially when dietary patterns are managed.<br>This trial aims to investigate the effects of exercise sequence in concurrent training (aerobic before resistance vs. resistance before aerobic) on cardiovascular function, biochemical biomarkers, and anthropometric indices in adults with Type 2 Diabetes, while accounting for dietary practices. |
