## Now is the time to take the next step for your heart.

You want to know that **you're OK.**

You want **deeper health insights** than traditional blood pressure devices provide.

You’re concerned how hypertension impacts your **heart, kidneys, and brain**.

You want a device **backed by cardiologists**, validated research, and clinical trials.

You want to track your cardiovascular health **over time at home.**

You want insights you can trust— **clear, personalized, accurate, and reliable.**

You’re making **lifestyle changes** and want to measure your progress.

You’re ready to **investigate heart health** due to fatigue, circulation issues, or risk signs.

No matter where you are in your heart health journey, CONNEQT Pulse helps you **take control** of your future.

## More Predictive Data = More Proactive Health

### Research-Backed Health Insights

Traditional blood pressure readings only tell part of the story. CONNEQT Pulse uses Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA) to measure key vascular biomarkers that predict cardiovascular (CV) risk before symptoms appear.

### Results & Clinical Interpretation of CONNEQT Arterial Health Biomarkers

| Measurement | Central Blood Pressure | Central Pulse Pressure | Pulse Pressure Amplification | Augmentation Pressure | Augmentation Index |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Threshold1 | >130 mmHg | >50 mmHg | <130% | Each 10 mmHg increase in AP | Each 10 % increase in Alx |
| Risk of Cardiovascular Events | 3x<br> increased risk of cardiovascular events2 | 2-3x<br> increased risk of cardiovascular events2 | 2-3x<br> increased risk of cardiovascular events2 | 30%<br>Increase risk of cardiovascular events2 | 35-40%<br>Increase risk of cardiovascular events2 |

Scroll to the right >

A 4-mmHg reduction in central pressure can lower cardiovascular risk by 20%. Reductions in arterial stiffness have been shown with ACE-inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors.

1 These thresholds are population-based and may differ from your personalized reference range.

2 CV events are defined as a myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, stroke, heart failure, or CV mortality.

By tracking these biomarkers, CONNEQT Pulse helps detect hidden risks, optimize heart health, and empower better cardiovascular decisions.

Chang, et al, Hypertension, 2022

- > “In a study of 3,500 high risk adults **central pulse pressure is 32% better** than brachial blood pressure in predicting cardiovascular events”​







The Strong Heart Study, Roman et al, Hypertension, 2007.

- > **Increased vascular stiffness** is a predictor of cardiovascular events and all cause mortality independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors​







Lancet Commission on Hypertension

- > “You can’t practice hypertension medicine anymore without measuring central blood pressure”​







Dr. Mark Houston - Director, Hypertension Institute
