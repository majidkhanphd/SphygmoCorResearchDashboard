Task: Refine Featured Publications Layout, Sidebar Behavior, and DOI/Abstract Display

Please implement the following UX and layout improvements.

⸻

1. Featured Publications Cards

Title & Authors
	•	Fix the truncation of publication titles on the featured pages so the full title is visible by default, or only truncated in a controlled way (e.g., with ellipsis) that doesn’t cut off too aggressively.
	•	Fix the author list display so it is not permanently cut off inside the card.
	•	Within each featured publication card, add an expand/collapse toggle, similar in feel to the dropdown behavior we use in the sidebar:
	•	Collapsed (default) state:
	•	Compact view with:
	•	Full (or cleanly truncated) title
	•	Journal + year line
	•	Short author list, in a way that doesn’t look abruptly cut off
	•	Card height should be relatively small/compact.
	•	Expanded state:
	•	Show:
	•	Full title
	•	Full author list
	•	Journal + year line
	•	Abstract text for that publication (for featured publications, the abstract should appear only when expanded).
	•	User can collapse back to the compact view.

Read Paper / DOI Handling
	•	Remove the “Read paper” link/button currently shown at the bottom of the featured publication cards.
	•	Instead, add a small DOI link inline next to the journal, year line (same style as elsewhere in the app where DOI is displayed).
	•	Goal is to keep the card visually clean and compact while still giving clear access to the DOI link.

2. Sidebar Default Size & Behavior
	•	Set the default width of the sidebar to the minimum visible width right before it disappears:
	•	On first load, the sidebar should appear in this compact, minimal width.
	•	Users should still be able to drag and expand the sidebar to a wider width up to the current maximum width.
	•	Introduce a safe threshold before auto-collapse:
	•	Add a small buffer zone so that the sidebar does not immediately disappear with very slight mouse movement or small drags to the left.
	•	The sidebar should only fully collapse and disappear once the user clearly drags past a defined minimum threshold, to avoid accidental hide behavior.
	•	Maintain the existing maximum width limit:
	•	Preserve the current maximum width the sidebar can expand to.
	•	Do not change that max-width value; ensure resizing logic respects both the minimum visible width and the existing maximum width.

3. Constraints / Acceptance Criteria
	•	No regression in existing sidebar hide/show behavior, aside from making it less sensitive to accidental small drags when approaching the collapse threshold.
	•	No visual clipping of titles, author lists, journal/year, DOI, or abstract when cards are expanded.
	•	The expand/collapse behavior for featured publication cards should feel consistent and intuitive, similar to the interaction patterns we already use (e.g., sidebar dropdowns).
	•	Featured cards should look cleaner and more compact in their collapsed state, with the abstract only visible on expand and the DOI shown inline next to the journal/year.
