You are an AI pair programmer helping refactor and polish the CONNEQT Health Research site.
Work in plan mode first: inspect the existing codebase, propose concrete file-level changes, and only then proceed to implementation.

High-level goals
	1.	Keep the banner/hero at the very top of the research page and treat it as a future hub for navigation.
	2.	Replace the existing “CONNEQT Health Research” text in the top-left area with the actual company logo.
	3.	Simplify and tighten the research highlights / featured research / recent breakthroughs section to reduce visual clutter and dead space.
	4.	Update the banner text to a single concise line, moving other descriptive text below the banner.
	5.	Change the publications listing so the default items per page is 25 instead of 50.
	6.	Preserve existing functionality, responsiveness, and styling consistency across the site.

Specific tasks

1. Keep the banner up top and prepare it for future navigation
	•	Locate the banner/hero section at the top of the research page.
	•	Ensure this banner remains at the very top of the page and continues to span the full width.
	•	Within the banner layout, make sure there is a clear structure (e.g., a flex container) that can later hold:
	•	The logo (top left).
	•	Potential future navigation links or buttons (e.g., a right-aligned area that can remain empty for now or contain a small placeholder).
	•	Do not remove the banner; just refine its layout to support future additions.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	The banner remains at the top of the page.
	•	The internal layout of the banner clearly supports adding navigation items later (e.g., left-aligned logo and reserved space to the right).
	•	No visual regressions on desktop and mobile.

2. Replace “CONNEQT Health Research” with the actual company logo
	•	Find the element in the banner/header that currently displays the text label (e.g., “CONNEQT Health Research” / “Connect Health Research”) in the top-left region.
	•	Replace that text element with the company logo image:
	•	Use the existing logo asset in the project if available (e.g. /assets/logo.svg or similar).
	•	If multiple versions exist, choose the one already used in other parts of the site for consistency.
	•	Add appropriate alt text (e.g., "CONNEQT Health logo").
	•	If appropriate, make the logo clickable and link it to the site’s main home or research home route.
	•	Remove any styles or props that are only relevant to the old text label.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	The top-left area of the banner shows the actual company logo instead of the text.
	•	The layout remains visually balanced and consistent with the site’s design language.
	•	(Optional but preferred) The logo acts as a link back to the home/research root.
	•	No console errors or unused imports related to the removed text element.

3. Update banner heading text and move description below the banner
	•	In the same banner/hero section, set the main heading text to exactly:
CONNEQT Health Arterial Intelligence Research
	•	Any additional descriptive text currently inside the banner (subheadings, paragraphs, explanatory text) should be moved:
	•	Out of the banner container.
	•	Placed below the banner and above the “Research Highlights” section (or the first main content section).
	•	Style this moved text as an introductory body paragraph (or paragraphs) to the research content:
	•	Maintain typography consistent with other body text on the site.
	•	Ensure spacing between the banner, the intro text, and the “Research Highlights” heading is visually clean but not too loose.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	The banner displays a single, clear heading: “CONNEQT Health Arterial Intelligence Research”.
	•	Introductory descriptive text appears below the banner and above “Research Highlights”.
	•	The flow from banner → intro text → highlights feels natural and uncluttered.

4. Remove the orange line and tighten vertical spacing in research sections
	•	Identify the orange line associated with:
	•	Research Highlights
	•	Featured Research
	•	Recent Breakthroughs
	•	Remove this orange line from the layout (likely a styled <hr>, border, or decorative div).
	•	After removal, adjust vertical spacing between headings and content:
	•	Reduce excessive top/bottom margins and padding in these sections.
	•	Keep enough whitespace for readability and clear section separation.
	•	Verify spacing at common breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Acceptance criteria:
	•	The orange line no longer appears.
	•	The vertical whitespace between research sections is more compact with no large dead spaces.
	•	The page remains responsive and visually coherent.

5. Change default publications per page from 50 to 25
	•	Locate the pagination logic for the publications listing (component, hook, or API call).
	•	Change the default page size from 50 to 25:
	•	This may be a constant, a default parameter, or initial state value.
	•	If a UI control exists for page size:
	•	Ensure its default selected value is 25.
	•	Verify other options, if any, are labeled and functioning correctly.
	•	Confirm this change flows through:
	•	The data fetching / query parameters.
	•	The rendered list of publications.
	•	The pagination controls (total page count, current page tracking, etc.).

Acceptance criteria:
	•	On initial load of the publications page (no filters applied), exactly 25 publications are shown by default.
	•	Pagination behaves correctly when navigating between pages.
	•	No inconsistencies in total counts or page numbers.

Implementation details & constraints
	•	Do not break existing filtering, sorting, or searching behavior on the publications page.
	•	Preserve responsiveness across all breakpoints.
	•	Reuse existing design tokens, CSS utilities, and components where possible instead of introducing ad hoc styles.
	•	In the plan phase, clearly list:
	•	Which files and components you will modify.
	•	What changes will be made in each file (e.g., “replace text header with logo component”, “update pageSize constant from 50 to 25”).
	•	Any props, components, or helpers added or removed.

After planning, implement the proposed changes and verify that the updated UI satisfies all acceptance criteria above.
