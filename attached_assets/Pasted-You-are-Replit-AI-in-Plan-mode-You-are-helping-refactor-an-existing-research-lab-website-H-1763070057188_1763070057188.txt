You are Replit AI in **Plan mode**. You are helping refactor an existing research lab website.

## High-level goal

Restructure the site so that there is essentially **one primary website experience** centered on the **Publications page**, and deprecate/remove several other sections — **without breaking existing functionality**.

We want:
- A single main entry experience focused on Publications.
- Some former “Research Highlights” content moved into the Publications page header area.
- A **hero/animated banner placeholder** (for a future pulse-wave animation) similar in spirit to the Apple Machine Learning page hero.
- All of this done carefully so existing routes, components, and data fetching for Publications remain stable.

---

## Current situation (assumptions)

- The site currently has multiple top-level pages/sections, including:
  - **Overview**
  - **Research Highlights**
  - **Events**
  - **Work With Us**
  - **Publications** (this is the main publications experience we want to keep and enhance)
- These pages are likely exposed in:
  - Navigation (header/footer links, menus)
  - Routing (framework-specific routes, e.g., Next.js/React Router/etc.)
  - Possibly shared layout components.

You should:
- Infer the exact structure from the codebase.
- Explicitly call out where you are making assumptions and how you would verify them in Work mode.

## Required changes

### 1. Deprecate/remove extra pages safely

We want to **remove or retire** the following pages as separate destinations:

- Overview
- Research Highlights (as a standalone page)
- Events
- Work With Us

**Requirements:**

- Update navigation so these pages **no longer appear as top-level links**.
- Ensure there are **no broken links** (404s) or orphaned routes:
  - If other parts of the site link to these pages, either:
    - Update links to point to the new main Publications experience, **or**
    - Implement safe redirects (route-level) to the Publications page.
- Confirm that any shared layout or navigation components do not assume the existence of these pages.
- Document exactly **which files, routes, and components** are changed or removed.

### 2. Make Publications the main landing experience

We want the user to effectively land on the **Publications page** as the main site.

**Requirements:**

- If there is a traditional “home” or “overview” route, adjust routing so:
  - The main landing path (e.g., `/` or the primary entry point) either:
    - Shows the Publications page directly, **or**
    - Renders a new wrapper that is effectively the Publications experience plus the new header content (see below).
- Do **not** break:
  - Existing publication filters, pagination, and data loading.
  - Any query parameters or APIs currently used by Publications.
- If you need to refactor the Publications page layout to add new blocks at the top, do so in a way that:
  - Keeps the core list/table/grid of publications intact.
  - Preserves existing components where possible (avoid rewriting the entire page).

### 3. Integrate “Research Highlights” into the Publications page header

We want some of the **former Research Highlights content** to appear at the top of the Publications page.

**Requirements:**

- Identify key pieces of “Research Highlights” content that make sense as:
  - A featured section (e.g., “Research Highlights”)
  - Or a “Recent Breakthroughs” strip/cards at the top.
- Design a **top-of-page section** on the Publications page that can include:
  - A short title and description (e.g., “Research Highlights” / “Recent Breakthroughs”).
  - One or more highlight items (cards or tiles) with:
    - Title
    - Very short description
    - Optional link to relevant publications or external resources.
- Make this section configurable/data-driven where reasonable (e.g., driven by JSON/config or CMS data if present), so that future updates do not require code changes.

### 4. Add a hero/banner section with placeholder animation

We eventually want a **pulse-wave style animated hero banner**, visually somewhat inspired by Apple’s Machine Learning page. For now:

**Requirements (for this phase):**

- Implement a **hero/banner component** at the very top of the Publications experience that:
  - Spans the width of the page (full-width section).
  - Has a visually clean, modern layout suitable for a future animation.
  - Includes **placeholder content** for now (e.g., a subtle gradient background, static SVG or simple CSS animation placeholder).
  - Contains text fields like:
    - Main heading (e.g., “Cardiovascular Research & Publications”)
    - Subheading/short description.
- Architect the hero so that:
  - Swapping the placeholder with a future pulse-wave animation will be straightforward.
  - The hero component is isolated (e.g., `HeroBanner` or similar component).
- Do **not** copy Apple’s design exactly — use it only as high-level inspiration (full-width hero, modern, minimal).

---

## Constraints & safety checks

- **Do not break the Publications page:**
  - Existing filters, pagination, and search must remain fully functional.
  - APIs and data fetch logic must not be disrupted.
- **No broken navigation:**
  - Before and after changes, list all routes that previously existed and their new behavior (e.g., redirect target, removed, or repurposed).
- Respect existing design system and component patterns:
  - Reuse existing layout/grid/typography components where possible.
  - Keep the visual style consistent with the current site.

## What I want from you in Plan mode

1. **Codebase analysis**
   - Identify:
     - The files, routes, and components for:
       - Overview
       - Research Highlights
       - Events
       - Work With Us
       - Publications
     - Where navigation items are defined (header, footer, sidebars).
   - Summarize the current structure and how Publications is currently used.

2. **Step-by-step implementation plan**
   - Break the work into logical tasks/steps, such as:
     1. Map routes and navigation.
     2. Create/adjust main entry route to Publications.
     3. Implement hero/banner component and integrate at top.
     4. Extract and integrate Research Highlights into new top section.
     5. Safely deprecate/remove Overview/Research Highlights/Events/Work With Us pages.
     6. Add redirects or link updates to avoid broken paths.
     7. Run and describe testing/QA steps.
   - For each step, describe:
     - **What** will be done.
     - **Which files/components** are likely involved.
     - Any **risks** and how to mitigate them.

3. **Acceptance criteria**

Define clear acceptance criteria, including but not limited to:

- Visiting the main URL (e.g., `/`) shows the Publications experience with:
  - Hero/banner at the top.
  - Research Highlights/Recent Breakthroughs section under the hero.
  - Existing Publications listing and filtering intact.
- No navigation links point to the old Overview/Research Highlights/Events/Work With Us pages.
- Any direct visits to deprecated routes behave gracefully (redirect or handled page).
- No console errors or obvious layout regressions on the Publications page.
- The hero/banner is implemented as a reusable, easily upgradable component.
