Title: Admin Page Pagination + Layout Fix + Featured Tab

1. Implement Pagination on Admin Page

Problem: The admin page attempts to load the entire Approved Publications list at once, causing load failures and testing issues.
Goal: Apply the same pagination system used on the main publications page.

Tasks:
	•	Integrate the existing pagination component into the admin page’s Approved Publications list.
	•	Match items-per-page settings and pagination behavior to the main publications section.
	•	Ensure pagination is functional for Pending, Approved, and Rejected lists (if needed based on list size).

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	The admin page loads instantly without errors.
	•	Publications are displayed in pages rather than one long list.
	•	Pagination controls work identically to how they function on the main publications page.

2. Fix Admin Page Width / Column Layout

Problem: The admin table layout is too narrow; the Actions column is partially cut off, forcing horizontal scrolling.

Tasks:
	•	Increase the max width of the admin content area or adjust the layout grid.
	•	Ensure the table columns auto-adjust so all primary actions (Approve / Reject) are fully visible.
	•	Remove the need for horizontal scrolling for core admin actions.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Admin table fits within the viewport width.
	•	The Approve/Reject buttons are fully visible without horizontal scroll.
	•	Layout remains responsive on medium and large screens.

3. Add a “Featured Publications” Tab

Goal: Better organization by isolating featured items into their own tab.

Tasks:
	•	Add a new tab labeled Featured alongside Pending, Approved, and Rejected.
	•	Create a new backend endpoint or query (if needed) to fetch featured publications.
	•	Ensure the same actions (e.g., remove from featured) are available within this tab.
	•	Display featured publications using the same table format and pagination rules.

Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Four tabs are visible: Pending, Approved, Rejected, Featured.
	•	Featured tab loads only featured items.
	•	Tab switching is smooth and follows existing UI conventions.

4. General QA
	•	Validate no regressions appear in the existing admin workflow.
	•	Confirm all table views respond correctly when resized.
	•	Confirm pagination and tab state persist correctly during navigation.
