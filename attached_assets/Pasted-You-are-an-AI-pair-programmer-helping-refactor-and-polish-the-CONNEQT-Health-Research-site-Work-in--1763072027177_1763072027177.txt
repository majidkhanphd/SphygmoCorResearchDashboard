You are an AI pair programmer helping refactor and polish the CONNEQT Health Research site.
Work in plan mode first: inspect the existing codebase, propose concrete file-level changes, and only then proceed to implementation.

High-level goals
	1.	Simplify and clean up the research highlights / featured research / recent breakthroughs section to reduce visual clutter and dead space.
	2.	Update the hero/banner copy to a single concise line, and move the existing descriptive text below the banner.
	3.	Adjust publications pagination so the default items per page is 25 instead of 50.
	4.	Ensure all changes preserve existing functionality, responsiveness, and styling consistency with the rest of the site.

Specific tasks

1. Remove “Connect Health Research” button
	•	Locate the component(s) that render the “Connect Health Research” button on the main research / publications page (likely in the hero/banner or header section).
	•	Remove this button from the UI and any unused handlers/props associated with it.
	•	Confirm there are no broken references (e.g., click handlers, imports, or styles that depend on this button).

Acceptance criteria:
	•	The “Connect Health Research” button no longer appears on the page.
	•	There are no console errors or unused imports related to this button.
	•	Layout remains visually balanced without the button.

2. Remove the orange line and tighten vertical spacing
	•	Identify the orange line that visually separates/relates to the sections:
	•	Research Highlights
	•	Featured Research
	•	Recent Breakthroughs
	•	Remove this orange line from the layout (likely a styled <hr>, border, or decorative div).
	•	After removing, adjust the vertical spacing between these sections so the layout is more compact and avoids large dead areas:
	•	Reduce excessive top/bottom margins and padding.
	•	Ensure headings and cards still have enough whitespace to remain readable.
	•	Keep the visual hierarchy clear (section headings should still stand out).

Acceptance criteria:
	•	The previous orange line is no longer visible on the page.
	•	The vertical whitespace between research-related sections feels tighter and more concise (no large empty gaps).
	•	Layout remains responsive and visually consistent across desktop and mobile breakpoints.

3. Update the banner text
	•	Find the banner/hero section for the research page (the area currently containing multiple lines of text).
	•	Replace the main banner heading text with exactly:
CONNEQT Health Arterial Intelligence Research
	•	Any other descriptive text that currently appears in the banner should be moved:
	•	Place it below the banner and above the “Research Highlights” section (or equivalent first content section).
	•	Maintain appropriate typography (e.g., body text style) and spacing so it reads as an introductory paragraph for the research content.

Acceptance criteria:
	•	The hero/banner now has a single, clear heading: “CONNEQT Health Arterial Intelligence Research”.
	•	The previous banner descriptive text appears as a paragraph (or paragraphs) below the banner and above Research Highlights.
	•	The overall page still looks clean and consistent with existing design (no duplicate text).

4. Change default publications per page from 50 to 25
	•	Locate the pagination logic and configuration for the publications listing:
	•	This may be in a publications list component, API query parameter, or pagination hook.
	•	Change the default page size from 50 to 25 items per page.
	•	If there is a UI control for changing page size, ensure:
	•	It defaults to 25.
	•	All options and labels remain accurate.
	•	Make sure this change correctly propagates to:
	•	The query or data-fetching logic.
	•	The displayed results.
	•	The pagination controls (total pages, current page, etc.).

Acceptance criteria:
	•	When first loading the publications page with no filters, exactly 25 publications are displayed per page by default.
	•	Pagination still works correctly for navigating through all publications.
	•	No errors or inconsistencies in total counts or page numbers.

Implementation details & constraints
	•	Do not break existing filtering, sorting, or search behavior on the publications page.
	•	Preserve existing responsive behavior (desktop, tablet, mobile). If you adjust spacing, ensure it still behaves well on smaller screens.
	•	Reuse existing design tokens, CSS classes, or style utilities where possible instead of introducing new, inconsistent styles.
	•	Provide a clear summary of:
	•	Which files will be changed.
	•	What modifications will be made in each file.
	•	Any new props, components, or helpers introduced or removed.

After planning, execute the changes you propose and ensure the updated UI matches the acceptance criteria above.
